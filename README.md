<h1>Building Traffic Light Webserver on Pineox64</h1>

<h2>Projects Description</h2>
The Ox64 is a RISC-V based single-board computer based on the Bouffalo Lab BL808 RISC-V SoC with C906 64-bit and E907/E902 32-bit CPU cores supported by 64 MB of embedded PSRAM memory, and with built-in WiFi, Bluetooh and Zigbee radio interfaces
<br />
<br />
The final project consisted of two parts:  
1. <b>Custom OS Development</b> â€” built with Buildroot for Pine Ox64, demonstrating OS fundamentals in an embedded environment.  
2. <b>Traffic Light Web Server</b> â€” controlled GPIO pins for traffic light simulation. Initially designed with Raspberry Pi + Apache but finalized using JavaScript for onboard control. 
The traffic light server was initially implemented with Raspberry Pi + Apache to control GPIO pins but was later replaced with a <b>JavaScript solution</b> to manage the onboard traffic light system.  
<br />

<h2>Project Detail Guideline</h2>
1. Configure Buildroot & cross-compilation toolchain for Pine Ox64.  <br />
2. Build minimal Linux-based OS image.  <br />
3. Flash image and test on Pine Ox64.  <br />
4. Implement GPIO control logic for traffic lights.  <br />
5. Deploy traffic light control server (attempted Apache, finalized JS control).  <br />
6. Validate traffic light operations and system response.
